# Landing Page Updates

Logging updates made to the landing page as part of the "Engagement and Activation" pivot.

## Branching Strategy

Updates are being done in the git branch `smith-updates`, create from `main` on Jan. 6, 2026.

## Asssets Required

For carousel in hero section:

- [ ] Mobile phone with UX in Hand
- [ ] Tokens in Colorful version
- [ ] Kiosk at airport GIF with walkers.

## Questions

1. Regarding this task: "Footer: Add the Discord SVG to the social cluster. Ensure it inherits the existing cyan/teal hover-glow effect." -- I don't see a hover-glow effect on the production site.
1. Hero size and alignment need review because they are pretty small in one line.
1. Is that little hero image being displayed correctly?
